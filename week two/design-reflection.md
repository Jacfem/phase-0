Creating a successful & smooth website requires a thoughtful & skilled process. Here are the steps you can take to creating a Website:

1. Information Gathering
It's important to think about what the purpose of the website is, and what you & your client are trying to accomplish. Will you be sharing information with the audience, and will you be aiming to sell them a product? Will your target audience be specialized, or more of a global audience?
It's important to consider what type of information the audience will be looking to gain from this website, in order to provide relevant content.

2. Planning
Once you've gathered some information about what content will be needed, and who the target audience is, it's time to draw/lay out a Site Map. This will help you visualize & organize the menu of the website. It's important to keep in mind the end user, whoever will be accessing your site once it's launched. What will they want to see, where will they want to see it? Keep in mind any forms that may be implemented, such as order or contact forms, and note down which technologies may need to be implemented for this (i.e. Wordpress).

3. Design
Now you can start thinking about the look & feel of the website, and how particularly your target audience will want to access the website. Incorporating company/client elements such as logos & colors will help strenghten the identity of the website, which will help the audience more clearly understand where they are. This is the phase where prototypes & mock-ups of the website will actually be created.

4. Development
Now it's time to actually create the website! It's somewhat of a best practice to first develop the Home Page, and then develop a "Shell" for the interior pages, which will act as a template & guide for the rest of your development phase. Once the Shell is created, you can distribute relevant content into the appropriate areas. This is also where you will re-visit any Content Management Systems, such as Wordpress in the example above, and implement them. 

5. Testing and Delivery
Before making the website live for all of your users, it's important to test the product for functionality & compatibility between different browsers. "Validating" your code is ensuring that your code is up to current web development standards, and once it's approved, it's time to deliver the site. A File Transfer Protocol program is used to upload the website to your server, and then you should do one final run-through to confirm that everything was correctly upoloaded. Install any plugins you may need, and optimize your website for search engines with keyword, title & description tags. After all of these details. your website should now be live & accessible to the public.

6. Maintenance
Once you launch the website, you may be updating and maintaining it depending on the nature of it. You might be updating and posting new content, and adding new features as it potentially grows. Other important things are regular site backups, and upgrades to stay up-to-date with web standards.


My website's primary purpose will be to act as a hub for my experience, and to showcase my portfolio for potential employers. The site will feature some projects that I'll make, information about myself & my goals, and contact informaion/social network links.

My target audience's interests will likely be potential Hiring Managers, people I meet via networking. My site will address them warmly, let them know they're on my portfolio and explain who I am, encourage them to take a look around, and invite them to contact me for work inquiries or just to chat.

The primary action the user should be taking when they're on my website is to view my work, and perhaps explore further by then exploring my GitHub or LinkedIn via links I'll provide. They'll also be able to contact me via my e-mail or perhaps a form.

User experience is a fairly new and quickly developing field which focuses on how a user feels while interfacing with a system or website. Historically, designers created websites to accommodate clients' needs & preferences, but the increase of attention on UX is shifting this perspective, and more companies are investing in a User's Experience of their product/website. This is important because good UX can make products stand out from the crowd of complex and clunky ones, and contribute to the success of a business. Accessibility is also a growing initiative, which focuses on ensuring a website is accessible for people with special requirements physically or with outdated devices. It's important to not exclude anyone from accessing the web, and if they are excluded, then there is no User Experience!

I didn't find anything about this challenge tedious, but can imagine that the Maintenance phase of web design might be more tedious than other phases.
