- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    It was good to see it in action! I enjoyed the practice of simulating the website rather than coming up with one ourselves, because it allowed us to be detail-oriented and not flexible about changes. This is a good practice and one that I'd like to do on my own with some more websites.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
    Good! We didn't do too much research, but incorporated unordered lists, paragraphs, and links. The one thing we did research on was <meta charset-"UTF-8"> when we saw that the copyright symbol translated into a bit of gibberish. This is a character set that supports most characters and symbols in the world, a feat that some of the character sets in the past were not able to do.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
    We ran our code through a Validator several times to keep us on track in terms of closed tags and such, which was helpful. We didn't do any formatting, but went with an unordered list for the links in the webpage, so that they would show up with bullet points. I did want to try the superscript tag for some of the smaller text, but I don't think it would have worked as intended.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
    HTML seems great for laying things out and getting immediate feedback through a validator regarding if you're on track or have errors. I like that semantic HTML has so many tags to choose from to fit the right job, and inherently to its name, it's logical!
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
    I think practice will help, but in general starting with a skeleton of doctype, html, head, title and body is helpful for me. Then I fill in the appropriate information from there, and keep validating as you go!
