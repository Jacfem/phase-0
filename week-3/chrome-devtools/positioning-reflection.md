How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
It's a lot easier to format and position elements in real-time using Chrome's DevTools than I realized. It's a great way to adjust styles, sizes, colors, and positioning in a much more visual way than just using your text editor & refreshing a web page would allow. On any web page in Chrome, click 'View' on the top of your page, hover over 'Developer' and click 'Developer Tools.' Now, you can open up any element & its CSS to live-edit any of its properties, as well as add or take away any that you'd like to see make changes to the page.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
Re-sizing elements turned out to be one of my favorite modifications to make on the DOM. When you have your developer tools open, click on the element you'd like to re-size, and under the CSS properties of this element, modify 'height' and 'width'. You can either use the pixels, em, or percentage units.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Elements are positioned by using top, bottom, right, and left properties, but need the 'position' property to be defined before it will take those directions. By default, an element is in a static position. By changing to absolute positioning, this will position the element in relation to the 1st parent of this element that is NOT static. Relative positioning moves the element relative to where it would have been if static. Fixed positioning anchors an element to a browser window, so that wherever you scroll, it stays fixed on your screen. I found

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
Margin, border, and padding (in order from most outward on the box model to most inward, right next to the content) are CSS properties that help arrange the look of a page. The margin will define the amount of space around an element, and does not have a color to it. The border will define the color and style of an element's border, and some properties are width, color, and style (dotted, dashed, solid, double). Padding will define the space between the element border & the element content. So, while margin & padding are defining some spatial aspects, and borders don't create space, all three are essential to arrange elements on a page in a nice way.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
To be honest, I started it with not very strong CSS knowledge, but I learned a lot from the real time feedback that the page's adjustments gave. I didn't love it, mostly because it felt awkward, but being unfamiliar with developer tools could've contributed to that. Overall, it taught me a lot!
