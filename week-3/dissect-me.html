<!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
I used doctype, html, body, head, title, main, section, h1, and p for this challenge.
These still feel like the basics to a clean, structured website.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order
the browser uses to display elements?
Elements get laid out depending on where in the HTML page they're written, through style sheets (CSS),
as well as what their inherent tags mean. They also may be nested inside other tags.
Browsers read a page's code and interpret the elements in the order they were written.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge?
Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I'm currently using Atom text editor, but I learned that you can create snippets to help
you save skeletons of code for structuring your projects. It seems really cool & it looks like
Atom has the same feature, so I'm going to be creating some.
