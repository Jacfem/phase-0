What does puts do?
In Ruby, puts means 'put string' and it writes whatever comes after it to your console. It returns 'nil' which in Ruby is an object that represents nothingness.

An integer is a number without any decimal points. Examples are 5, -100, 0. A float is a number with decimal points, more precisely defined as floating-point numbers. Examples are 5.5, -0.999, 6.012.

Float and Integer division
When you do arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) with integers, you'll always get integer answers. However, when you do arithmetic with floats, you'll get a float answer. For example, 4.5/2.2 returns 2.045(and repeats on and on) and 5/3 returns 1.
