What does puts do?
In Ruby, puts means 'put string' and it writes whatever comes after it to your console. It returns 'nil' which in Ruby is an object that represents nothingness.

An integer is a number without any decimal points. Examples are 5, -100, 0. A float is a number with decimal points, more precisely defined as floating-point numbers. Examples are 5.5, -0.999, 6.012.

Float and Integer division
When you do arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) with integers, you'll always get integer answers. However, when you do arithmetic with floats, you'll get a float answer. For example, 4.5/2.2 returns 2.045(and repeats on and on) and 5/3 returns 1. It's important to note that if you do arithmetic with an integer and a float, you'll get a float value as your result.

Mini-challenges:

Hours in a year:
Pseudo-code: I want to multiply the following:
Days in a year * Hours in a Days
Code:
365*24
8670

Minutes in a decade:
Pseudo-code: I want to multiply the following:
Years in a decade * Days in a year * Hours in a day * Minutes in an hour
Code:
10*365*24*60
5256000

Reflection
How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Ruby functions as a simple calculator when it comes to arithmetic. Respectively, we use the following symbols: addition +, subtraction -, multiplication * and division /.

What is the difference between integers and floats?
An integer is a number without any decimal points, whereas floats are numbers with decimal points. Integer examples are 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -4. Float examples are 4.4444, 3.2, 0.5, -1.2.

What is the difference between integer and float division?
When you divide integers, you'll always get an integer as an answer. When you divide floats, you'll always get a float as an answer. When you use an integer and a float in arithmetic, you will get a float answer.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
A string is a group of characters in a program. They can have letters, punctuation, digits, symbols, and spaces in them. Examples are "Dog", "Hello there!", " ", and "25".

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
When we use 'puts', we see something in our console, but the value is not saved anywhere. Local variables are useful when you want to store a value somewhere for later. Creating a local variable is known as 'assignment', and best practice is to begin the variable name with a lowercase letter. Some examples are my_variable = "Variable", first_string = "name", and number = 2.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
This was a nice review. It's different needing to check code in shell versus on a codeacademy or coderbyte module, so that process will take a little getting used to! It was helpful to define some best practices.
