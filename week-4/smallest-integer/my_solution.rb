# Smallest Integer

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# smallest_integer is a method that takes an array of integers as its input
# and returns the smallest integer in the array
#
# +list_of_nums+ is an array of integers
# smallest_integer(list_of_nums) should return the smallest integer in +list_of_nums+
#
# If +list_of_nums+ is empty the method should return nil

# Your Solution Below
def smallest_integer(list_of_nums)

end
smallest_integer(1, 4, 6)

=begin
Pseudocode:
Get integers as input
If there is an array of integers, sort them low to high
Return lowest integer
If it's an empty list, return nil
